## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice using Flexbox and choose more appropriate names for my classes.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to optimize the speed at which I implement designs, as I sometimes get distracted by details that arenâ€™t as relevant, which leads me to lose time. Additionally, I will focus on improving my CSS skills by using CSS Grid to complement Flexbox and create more complex layouts. I also plan to refine my CSS coding practices by concentrating on modularity and implementing methodologies like BEM for better organization and maintainability. Finally, I intend to delve into performance optimization techniques and ensure that my designs are fully responsive and accessible, applying best practices for web accessibility.
